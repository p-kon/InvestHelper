# InvestHelper
This tool helps to collect selected indicators, from a variety of sources (websites, api). 
The data is returned in the form of a csv file, which is then imported into excel where the data is further analyzed. 
Currently working only for PL stocks.


To do:

add USA market - almost finished
add crypto
refactoring - decide if US, PL and Crpyto have similar fields that can be separated into parent class (to use Inheritance/Polymorphism)
refactoring - add unit tests
refactoring - add error management + create error log file
