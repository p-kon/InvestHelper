This tool helps to collect selected indicators, from a variety of sources (websites, api). 
The data is returned to the form of a csv file, which is then imported into excel where the data is further analyzed. 
Currently working only for PL stocks.


To do:
	-> add USA market - almost finished,
	-> add ETF funds,
	-> add EU market,
	-> refactoring - decide if US, PL, ETF and EU have similar fields that can be separated into parent class (to use Inheritance/Polymorphism),
	-> refactoring - add unit tests,
	-> refactoring - add error management + create error log file.
